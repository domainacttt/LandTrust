# LandTrust
A blockchain-powered platform for transparent, decentralized land ownership and management, enabling communities to collectively own, govern, and develop land while ensuring fair access and dispute resolution.

---

## Overview
LandTrust addresses real-world issues of land ownership, such as lack of transparency, centralized control, and disputes over property rights, by leveraging blockchain technology. It uses 5 smart contracts built with Clarity to create a decentralized ecosystem for land tokenization, governance, and management.

### Smart Contracts
1. **LandToken Contract** – Tokenizes land parcels into fungible tokens for fractional ownership.
2. **GovernanceDAO Contract** – Enables token holders to propose and vote on land use decisions.
3. **LeaseManagement Contract** – Manages leasing agreements and automates rent distribution.
4. **DisputeResolution Contract** – Handles disputes with transparent, community-driven arbitration.
5. **OracleIntegration Contract** – Integrates off-chain land registry and legal data for verification.

## Features
- **Fractional Ownership**: Land is tokenized, allowing multiple owners to hold shares of a property.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Token holders vote on land development, sales, or leasing proposals.
- **Automated Leasing**: Smart contracts manage lease agreements and distribute rent to token holders.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Transparent, on-chain arbitration for conflicts over land use or ownership.
- **Real-World Integration**: Oracle connects to land registries and legal frameworks for compliance.

## Smart Contracts

### LandToken Contract
- Mints fungible tokens representing fractional ownership of land parcels.
- Tracks token ownership and transfers.
- Enforces restrictions on token trading to comply with local regulations.

### GovernanceDAO Contract
- Allows token holders to propose land use plans (e.g., development, conservation, or leasing).
- Implements token-weighted voting for decision-making.
- Executes approved proposals on-chain.

### LeaseManagement Contract
- Creates and manages lease agreements for land parcels.
- Automates rent collection and distribution to token holders based on ownership share.
- Tracks lease terms and enforces penalties for violations.

### DisputeResolution Contract
- Enables token holders to file disputes over land use or ownership.
- Facilitates community-driven arbitration with transparent voting.
- Logs all dispute outcomes on-chain for auditability.

### OracleIntegration Contract
- Connects to off-chain land registries for ownership verification.
- Integrates legal data to ensure compliance with local laws.
- Provides updates on land value or regulatory changes.

## Usage
Each smart contract is modular but integrates with others to form a cohesive land management system. Refer to individual contract documentation for detailed function calls and parameters.

- **LandToken**: Use to mint or transfer land ownership tokens.
- **GovernanceDAO**: Submit and vote on proposals via token-weighted functions.
- **LeaseManagement**: Create leases or collect rent programmatically.
- **DisputeResolution**: File or resolve disputes through on-chain arbitration.
- **OracleIntegration**: Query off-chain data for compliance or updates.
